# Introduction

The `DaparViz` package is a Shiny app which provides a series of plots dedicated to the analysis of proteomics data. It can 
deal with two data structures: `MSnSet` and `QFeatures`.

It has been developped as a Shiny module so as to be flexible: it can run standalone- or can be inserted in another Shiny app.
In that sense, it can be used on its own; or as a complement to the numerous 
Bioconductor packages (\url{https://www.bioconductor.org/}) it is compliant with; or through the `Prostar` interface.

`Prostar` (Proteomics statistical analysis with R) is a 
web interface based on Shiny technology (\url{http://shiny.rstudio.com/}) that provides GUI (Graphical User Interfaces).
The experiment package `DaparToolshedData` contains many datasets that can be used as examples.
`DaparViz` contains built-in plots but have the capability to show plots developped by other developper (as a Shiny app).


# Installation

To install this package, start R (version "4.3") and enter:

```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("DaparViz")
```

For older versions of R, please refer to the appropriate Bioconductor release.



# DaparViz data format

`DaparViz` has its own data format (the DaparViz-class) which is a 
simplification of the formats it can deal with. 
To see which data formats `DaparViz` can manage, run 

```

```

To see how to convert other data formats to DaparViz-class, run ?DaparViz-class
```

```

However, `DaparViz` plot functions integrate a convert feature so as to pass
directly datasets in other format to the plot functions.



# Using DaparViz

The functions in DaparViz use a specific data format which is described in the following section.

DaparViz is a collection of standard plots which are available as Shiny applications. Thus, each plot has its own application.

The main feature in DaparViz is a Shiny app which combine all the different Shiny app.

## Main UI

The Shiny app called view_dataset() is the main application of the package
`DaparViz`. It can be lauched as follows2:


```
library(DaparViz)
data(vData_ft)
view_dataset(vData_ft)
```

It is composed of two parts :
* a selection widget to select the dataset to show in the plots,
* a graphical part with clickable vignettes which represent the plots 
available. When the user clicks on one of those vignettes, the corresponding plot is showed below.

When a plot is displayed, it shows the data corresponding to the dataset selected in the widget. If this dataset is changed, the plot update automatically to the new dataset.


The list of vignettes is composed of :
* built-in shiny apps in the package `DaparViz`. See details with `listPlotsModules()`.
* external apps which are exported by other packages. For more details on the
development of an external app, see section xxx.






## Individual plots

Each of the built-in plots can be run in a standalone mode rather than embedded in the main UI.

It is possible simply by running its name. The list of all built-in shiny apps is available via

```
# Get the builtin shiny apps in DaparViz
listShinyApps()

# Get the external shiny apps that are embedded into DaparViz
listShinyApps()

# Get all the shiny apps which are avaialbie in the main UI
listShinyApps()
```


```
library(DaparViz)
data(vData_ft)
obj <- vData_ft[[1]]
listPlotModules()
ds_pca(obj)
ds_density(obj)

```
