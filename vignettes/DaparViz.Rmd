    The package DaparViz is a R package which provides functions to vizualize quantitative data from label-free proteomics experiments. It can deal with several data formats such as MSnSet, QFeatures or event simple lists. This document covers the functionalities available in `r BiocStyle::pkg_ver('DaparViz')`.

# Introduction

The `DaparViz` package is a Shiny app which provides a series of plots dedicated to the analysis of proteomics data. It can 
deal with two data structures: `MSnSet` and `QFeatures`.

It has been developped as a Shiny module so as to be flexible: it can run standalone- or can be inserted in another Shiny app.
In that sense, it can be used on its own; or as a complement to the numerous 
Bioconductor packages (\url{https://www.bioconductor.org/}) it is compliant with; or through the `Prostar` interface.

`Prostar` (Proteomics statistical analysis with R) is a 
web interface based on Shiny technology (\url{http://shiny.rstudio.com/}) that provides GUI (Graphical User Interfaces).
The experiment package `DaparToolshedData` contains many datasets that can be used as examples.
`DaparViz` contains built-in plots but have the capability to show plots developped by other developper (as a Shiny app).


# Installation

To install this package, start R (version "4.3") and enter:

```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("DaparViz")
```

For older versions of R, please refer to the appropriate Bioconductor release.

# Using DaparViz

The functions in DaparViz use a specific data format which is describe in the 
following section.

DaparViz is a collection of standard plots which are available as Shiny 
applications. Thus, each plot has its own application.

The main feature in DaparViz is a Shiny app which combine all the different
Shiny app.

## Internal data format

`DaparViz` has its own data format (the DaparViz-class) which is a 
simplification of the formats it can deal with. 
To see which data formats `DaparViz` can manage, run 

```

```

To see how to convert other data formats to DaparViz-class, run ?DaparViz-class
```

```

However, `DaparViz` plot functions integrate a convert feature so as to pass
directly datasets in other format to the plot functions.
