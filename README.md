### What is DaparViz?

`DaparViz` is a [Bioconductor
package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DaparViz) that provides
functions for the visualization and the statistical analysis of proteomics data.
It can deal with several formats as Msnset (used in the `MSnbase` package), 
`QFeatures` (in the QFeatures package) and list of datasets.

It is also possible to write your own plot modules so as to embed it into
the GUI of `DaparViz`.

> Evolving `DAPAR` package towards Shiny modules



### Getting started

The `VizData` and `VizList` classes are used to provide and manage a unique common
structure dataset within the package. See the
[DaparViz introduction](https://prostarproteomics.github.io/DaparViz/articles/DaparViz.html)
to get started with the visualisation of quantitative
mass spectrometry data.

The integration of an external plot module is illustrated in the [Add module](https://prostarproteomics.github.io/DaparViz/articles/addModule.html)
vignette.

### License

The `QFeatures` code is provided under a permissive [Artistic 2.0
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0). The
documentation, including the manual pages and the vignettes, are

# Installation

To install this package, start R (version "4.3") and enter:

```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("DaparViz")
```

This will also install dependencies.

It is also possible to install `DaparViz` from Github:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('prostarproteomics/DaparViz')

```

For older versions of R, please refer to the appropriate Bioconductor release.
